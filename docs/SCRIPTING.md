# Driving PULP without clicking

`PULP --script file.txt --log out.log [--no-audio] [--data-dir folder] [--size 1500x860]` (`PULP.exe` on Windows)

- `--control` instead of `--script`: commands are read from stdin as they arrive and what they log is written
  to stdout, for as long as stdin stays open. It is a normal run otherwise (the user's settings, the sound
  card unless `--no-audio`), without the crash-recovery question and the tour. Paths are relative to the
  working directory. When stdin closes PULP closes, asking first if there is unsaved work. This is how the
  MCP server in `mcp/` drives the program.
- `--no-audio` runs the engine from a silent background thread: nothing is played. Use it for every
  automated check that does not specifically test the sound card.
- A scripted run never writes the user's settings, recent files or autosaves. Give it `--data-dir <folder>` to
  let it keep those in a sandbox (needed to test autosave and crash recovery).
- Paths in a script are relative to the script file. One command per line; `#` starts a comment.
- `tools/loopback_capture.py` records what reaches the Windows default output device and compares it with a
  render, for the few tests that do play sound. Keep those quiet (`set master 0.2`) and short.

Targets: `main`, `toolbar`, `browser`, a window's content (`rack`, `piano`, `playlist`, `mixer`, `chan`,
`settings`, `export`, `events`, `link`), the window frame itself (`rackwin`, `pianowin`, ...), or `fx` for the newest effect editor.

The scripts used to check each milestone are in `scripts\`; their logs and screenshots land in `out\`.
